4. Feed ENV2 into filter
5. Feed LFO1 and LFO2 into VCA
6. Feed ENV1 and ENV2 into VCO1
7. Feed LFO2, ENV1 and ENV2 into VCO1
8. LFO waveforms
9. Rand for LFO1 and LFO2
10. Noise for VCO
11. Sequencers
12. VCO sync
13. Save/restore state
14. Collections of controls?
15. Estimate better dynamic range
16. Factor out VCO
17. Draw filter graph
18. Oscilloscope
19. Animate ADSR
20. Jump from A to R if key released
21. Logarithmic knobs
23. Smarter placement of Bezier control points (Good control points for exp(-x) on [0,a] should also be good for exp(-2x) on [0,a/2] but that has an obvious shortcoming.)
24. Slider
25. Better switch

Done

3. ADSR graph for ENV2
22. Plot ADSR with Béziers
1. Get ADSR graph right
2. Delay in ADSR graph
