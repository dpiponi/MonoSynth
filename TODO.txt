1. Get ADSR graph right
2. Delay in ADSR graph
4. Feed ENV2 into filter
5. Feed LFO1 and LFO2 into VCA
6. Feed ENV1 and ENV2 into VCO1
7. Feed LFO2, ENV1 and ENV2 into VCO1
8. LFO waveforms
9. Rand for LFO1 and LFO2
10. Noise for VCO
11. Sequencers
12. VCO sync
13. Save/restore state
14. Collections of controls?
15. Estimate better dynamic range
16. Factor out VCO
17. Draw filter graph
18. Oscilloscope

Done
